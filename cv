PROFILE

I am a Junior Front-end developer who always open for exploring something new. I am self-motivated and responsible person. Why have I chosen Front-end development? The answer is obvious, only this sphere combines technical skills and creativity as a whole. It is unique! I have decided to work in IT because the world is becoming digitalized and I would like to be a professional that helps a user to find and observe any sorts of information in the most interacting and attractive way. I am self-developing every day because I want to find and improve as many skills as possible. Furthermore, I am a friendly person that can start up conversation with anyone. I am delighted to work in a team. As from my university experience, I wasn't struggling to work with managers and other developers.
When it comes to my hobbies, I am obsessed with photography, art, volunteering, tourism, playing the guitar, playing volleyball and, of course, reading.
